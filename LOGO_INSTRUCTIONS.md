# Logo Update Instructions

## Step 1: Save the Logo Image
1. Save the Grassroot Innovation logo image (the circular logo with the tree, farming silhouettes, and "GRASSROOT INNOVATION" text) as `logo.png`
2. Replace the placeholder file at: `src/assets/logo.png`
3. The recommended size is 200x200 pixels or larger (it will be automatically resized)
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, SVG

## Step 2: Verify the Update
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
2. Check that the logo appears in:
   - The navigation bar (top left)
   - The footer (bottom left section)

## What's Already Done
✅ Added logo import to App.jsx
✅ Updated navbar to display logo alongside brand text
✅ Updated footer to include logo
✅ Added CSS styles for proper logo display

## Logo Placement
- **Navbar**: Logo appears at 40x40 pixels next to "GRI Grassroot Innovation"
- **Footer**: Logo appears at 32x32 pixels next to the brand text

The logo will be displayed as a circular image with proper spacing and alignment.
