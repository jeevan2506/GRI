# TODO: Optimize FieldVisit Page

## Tasks
- [x] Modify past visits section to display only the most recent past visit
- [x] Ensure Firebase database connection is properly initialized
- [x] Remove unnecessary sections to keep only registration option (remove past visits display if not needed, keep future visits and registration)
- [x] Optimize for speed: remove sample data fallback, streamline loading

## Followup Steps
- [x] Test Firebase connection
- [x] Verify page loads quickly
- [x] Check registration functionality
